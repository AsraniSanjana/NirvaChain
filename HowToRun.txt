step1: to run the sc and get contract addr + abi
1. download the code from github, unzip it
2. open w vscode, open terminal, run the following cmds:
npm init ( creates package.json )
npm start  ( creates package-lock.json )
npm install ( node modules )
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat (creates hardhat.config file)
npm install dotenv --save
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers "ethers@^5.0.0"
npm hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

once u have the addr where the contract is deployed at, u can do its ui which is standalone.

step2 to make ui for the deployed sc

now after running everything and getting a contract address where the code is running, run:
npm install 
npm start


(the constant folder has the contract abi and address, which youll have to edit according to your own code and change the ui code for components.js and app.js, etc. accordingly )
